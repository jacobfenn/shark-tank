1,Daymond is such a savage for talking trash to Robert. Lol,,,,,,
1,Robert was lucky. Within a year ToyGaroo was out of business,,,,,,
1,Robert's look was priceless lol,,,,,,
1,Man. Old episodes were so tense.,,,,,,
1,Poor Robert...even multi millionaires have feelings,,,,,,
1,Owning 10% while her husband retains 50% tells me she isn’t the business owner I’d want on my team.,,,,,,
1,this was peak Shark Tank,,,,,,
1,Mattel wont forget mr wonderfull for all the wrong reasons,,,,,,
1,Damon rubbing salt in his wound,,,,,,
1,priceless  Robert's reaction and Daymond's too,,,,,,
1,"Lol, sharks thought they were investing in the next Netflix. They are much wiser now.",,,,,,
1,"That laugh hahaha from Damon, damn it",,,,,,
1,This turned out to be a blessing for Robert and a nightmare for Kevin Cuban,,,,,,
1,You would think toy companies wouldn't like her because it reduces their sales.,,,,,,
1,Daymond poured gasoline on this one from his diabolical laugh...,,,,,,
1,Robert actually lucked out,,,,,,
1,Kevin “Those toys are my friends & I speak toy”,,,,,,
1,I'm curious how someone who only owns 10% of the business is able to sell 40% of said business.,,,,,,
1,Giving away equity to online marketers? Stupidest thing I've ever heard.,,,,,,
1,"This is what ""nothing personal, its just business"" is lol",,,,,,
1,"Not proprietary in any way, so no IP, and only 10% owner? No way, it stinks! If you come up with a product or service that doesn't exist anywhere yet, you better find all key aspects, methods, and characteristics of it to patent, trademark, and truly own! Because the moment you hesitate or don't know better it'll be too late and any public exposure will become prior art against itself for patents!",,,,,,
1,Poor Robert they cut him out the deal quick,,,,,,
1,"Oh bullahit Barbara you was NEVER in to begin with ya ole bag, lmao",,,,,,
1,Daemon enjoying it,,,,,,
1,Robert didn't like yhe betrayal,,,,,,
1,"the great lines i would like to be reminded of

"" do you have a pre-nuptial agreement?

OH~~""

""those toys are my friends
i speak toy""",,,,,,
1,the husband fked up by not going lol,,,,,,
1,hahahahah best episode and ive seen them all mark and kevin whattt,,,,,,
1,Oh man Robert was filthy. Never seen any shark have so much disdain after losing a deal.,,,,,,
1,I think Kevin and Mark would be a perfect team for this.,,,,,,
1,That one was the most exciting I've seen in a while.,,,,,,
1,"I mean... she came in asking 100k for 10%, that would put 20% at 200k price. They were super interested and haggling between themselves, she should've negotiated less than 35% for 200k.",,,,,,
1,"Ouch, remember when Netflix used to mail you DVDs",,,,,,
1,No you weren't Barbera.,,,,,,
1,"i get it that together they own 60%, but why give employees of the company shares so early on ? and 40% makes it impossible to raise capital, such a good idea but with things like that it becomes complicated",,,,,,
1,She wants you to bid against yourself? Im pretty sure she wants him to bid against robert and mark.,,,,,,
1,"Kevin ""Nicki, I wish you owned more; nevertheless, I'm a shark so here's my offer""",,,,,,
1,"Why are they asking her questions that they, the sharks should know already?",,,,,,
1,Strictly business nothing personal,,,,,,
1,Why is the volume so frekin low,,,,,,
1,Man this show was way different early on lol,,,,,,
1,"I know the real numbers.
Back in the 80's I didn't get 50 British pounds worth of toys a year

Once my dad bought something expensive I could borrow, a Commodore 64. But when I grew up I had nothing

No way would my parents spend 500 a year to borrow stuff.

Most children get very little and what she proposed for second hand? Didn't make sence",,,,,,
1,LOL robert,,,,,,
1,They look really young,,,,,,
1,I feel sorry for Robert,,,,,,
1,There is another company called “Lovevery” thats doing this with success,,,,,,
1,Why are they posting a video from 2011 now?? This is 14 years old!!!!!!!!,,,,,,
1,I LIKE TURTLES,,,,,,
1,Which season is this,,,,,,
1,I suspect Mark Cuban can call Mattel and they will take his call,,,,,,
1,What  about battery operated  toys?,,,,,,
1,"I feel so horrible  for Robert !!!!

And Roberts face!! It took all for his to not get up and smash those 2",,,,,,
1,Wow her mic is picking up every single noise lol,,,,,,
1,Shark Tank killed it off,,,,,,
1,Mark is waiting to eat the deal,,,,,,
1,I would've picked the other guy to be my partner rather than Mark. He wanted it more. Gotta love that hunger.,,,,,,
1,ROBERT WAS SO DISAPPOINTED lmao,,,,,,
1,how many times has mark done this to robert,,,,,,
1,damn i feel so bad for robert,,,,,,
1,The idea is ingenious. The execution wasn't.,,,,,,
1,Tell Robert before a future program to this NOT TO GET PLASTIC SURGERY,,,,,,
1,Haha that was great,,,,,,
1,Wow ruthless :),,,,,,
1,"That was so, so funny",,,,,,
1,But what if the people don’t send the toys back? Or if they get stolen/ or eaten by pets?,,,,,,
1,10% is crazy,,,,,,
1,this company filed for bankruptcy 10 months after shark tank.,,,,,,
1,Poor Robert!,,,,,,
1,Robert you got ditched hahahaha,,,,,,
1,"I feel bad for this woman... her giving up 40 of her 50% and her husband giving up none of his 50% is awful. That doesn't make any sense.

Edit: I take it back lol",,,,,,
1,Robert :,,,,,,
1,best episode yet,,,,,,
1,isn't that GURU,,,,,,
1,"Mark you suck , you left Robert out in the cold.. Damm",,,,,,
1,sharks were investing in anything back then,,,,,,
1,Lmaoo,,,,,,
1,"The problem is they are over stimulated to many toys they pick one up drop drop it, give them toys they love, just my opinion",,,,,,
1,This company went bankruptcy wild!,,,,,,
1,the biggest sharks in the tank can do what they want,,,,,,
1,"Yikes, this company was doomed to fail. Good idea but this lady was very naive in her approach to this. Company went out of business a year after cause they couldn't keep up with demand, pressure from the toy company, shipping and inventory costs which they nvr charged people for shipping for sum reason, under charging for the subscription itself, and scrutiny from the public for how they barely kept their toys clean enough. She had no idea what she was getting into if this ever blew up and now she knows since she sold off the company website and name. She probably has a regular job now cause she don't look like the type to try again being a entrepreneur",,,,,,
1,Toygaroo was made bankrupt the year after. Probably one of the biggest flops ever,,,,,,
1,I think the way Mr. Wonderful and Mark Cuban threw Robert under the bus was terrible. They are the most ruthless sharks in the tank.,,,,,,
1,It's crazy her husband let her give away her share but none of his and she's completely oblivious. Poor woman. Yeeeesh.,,,,,,
1,Can they do this with adult toys too? Once I get tired of my dildos can I trade them in?,,,,,,
1,Robert got thrown under the bus,,,,,,
1,robert...,,,,,,
1,This is not a good idea.,,,,,,
1,Hope you all have a good lunch!,,,,,,
1,The investment from the sharks means that you can have kids????,,,,,,
1,"After her 30 second pre pitch intro …. I’m out 
I don’t care what you have",,,,,,
1,Yeah she’s in an abusive relationship,,,,,,
1,Her husband looks like her son,,,,,,
1,"wow old shark tank, a bit bland... slow pace too.",,,,,,
1,It wasnt great after all,,,,,,
1,"I am so, so glad that the sharks hammered in on the fact that she's selling off her shares while the husband is keeping his 50%. Some people in the comments say that her husband is funding the business. She does give off stay-at-home mom energy, but I could be wrong. Well, if that's really the case, then let this be a lesson to women. ALWAYS have your own income, enough to fund your own life if you weren't married. When you don't have your own thing, you'll be controlled by someone else, and whether or not you have anything at all, will depend on that person's mood.

Wait, then isn't she offering her last 10%??? So she'll run a business without owning a single percent? Dumb. Absolutely dumb from her.",,,,,,
1,Fells like she is a pushover which is why the husband has 50%. Be careful girl!,,,,,,
1,She should divorce and sue the husband,,,,,,
1,This is such a stupid idea. Prove me wrong.,,,,,,
1,This woman life is sad omg she will tear is family apart bro 10 percent no,,,,,,
1,sneaky hubby,,,,,,
1,"People saying the upkeep of cleaning etc is too much and it failed because of that. Have you ever seen a dishwasher in a restaurant kitchen? Could easily wash 100s of these in an hour and i'm sure there's bigger ones.
Surprised this business failed. Management must have fumbled it.",,,,,,
1,Well that changed quickly,,,,,,
1,The betrayal  in the end,,,,,,
1,GREAT LUNCH PPL” I’m eating tamales”,,,,,,
1,good episode,,,,,,
1,i saw toys R us written all over her idk what the sharks saw kids dont play with toys no more! rent out a tablet or gaming systems or council & i woulda believed it more than,,,,,,
1,Shark Tank was crap back in the day huh,,,,,,
1,"We gad that here in Canada in the 70's Toys would rotate every few months, parents would get charged if they are damaged,",,,,,,
1,"Offcause Mattel never will forget him, just look into his history and see what happened",,,,,,
1,Horrible business model,,,,,,
1,And Damon just showed how much of a douche he is! Robert is the only person on there I  would consider partnering with!,,,,,,
1,Trump crushed And pulverised such Temu companies.,,,,,,
1,First,,,,,,
1,Robert,,,,,,
1,Facebook Marketplace and toy swapping has completely made this idea obsolete.,,,,,,
1,She got screwed by hubby,,,,,,
1,Germs!,,,,,,
1,19th comment,,,,,,
1,yes lord,,,,,,
1,Great Idea,,,,,,
1,"Robert, what happened?",,,,,,
1,"JESUS IS KING, REPENT NOW OR PERIIIISHH",,,,,,
1,JESUS IS LORD,,,,,,
1,"Bwahahahahahaha 
    Bwahahahahahaha 

Robert got we and truly f*cked over sideways",,,,,,
1,She loves kevin,,,,,,
1,20th comment,,,,,,
2,"Guy spent 3/4 of a million on a handle for a handle, madness",,,,,,
2,Robert was trying to figure out how that guy contacted his wife without him knowing,,,,,,
2,$750k for robert's family appearance fee,,,,,,
2,Terrible decision to let Momma walk away without the handles on her two baby seats,,,,,,
2,Kimmy doesn't use the device when leaving!,,,,,,
2,Bro invested almost $1M in a handle,,,,,,2.0
2,Robert just destroyed that product,,,,,,
2,How you bring a sharks wife out with your product and still dont get a deal,,,,,,
2,How’s this dude know Robert’s wife,,,,,,
2,what a great invention        a handle to carry your handle,,,,,,
2,"""Robert, your scaring that child"" child looks like it just saw a legit GHOST",,,,,,
2,Shark's right. $750k grand for THAT ONE ONLY is crazy. Chasing patents before chasing the sales is dumb tbh.,,,,,,
2,the baby's face at  is so memeable,,,,,,
2,The way the baby was looking at Robert was hysterical,,,,,,
2,robert's wife needs a lug bug for her ring! did you see that thing?,,,,,,
2,"After our 1st child carrying the ""normal"" way we found out about the alternative way Robert showed feeding your arm through the side and holding onto the pivot part of the handle.  Big time game changer and is quite comfortable.",,,,,,
2,"barbara: because your alive, i’m out.",,,,,,
2,"I'm just a handle, who plays a handle, that attaches to another handle.",,,,,,
2,Her hand must be pretty strong from wearing that giant wedding ring.,,,,,,
2,“Robert your scaring that child” Lmfao,,,,,,
2,"Barbara: you have a patent , I’m out",,,,,,
2,“You believe in yourself and for that reason I’m out” - Barbara,,,,,,
2,"Robert: Where’d you get the $750K Nathan?
Nathan: Maybe ask your wife Robert",,,,,,
2,"“I’m not gonna give the koombiyah”
** proceeds to give koombiyah",,,,,,
2,Those kids won the spawn point lottery.,,,,,,
2,I don’t think Robert liked this guy using his wife and kids to demonstrate this product without him knowing,,,,,,
2,"dude was sweating when robert showed the alternative method to holding the car seat, like damn, i just spent $1m and didn't know that",,,,,,
2,"I immediately thought about the way Robert picked up the seat, because that’s what my wife and I do.",,,,,,
2,"another awesome barb remark, she's too good",,,,,,
2,"I haven't seen that kinda baby carrier in years, they all rotate now",,,,,,
2,the child is legit scared lmao,,,,,,
2,if Robert had a flap jacket on that would have been the moment to flap that lol,,,,,,
2,Company is no longer around.,,,,,,
2,"Website shows out of stock and their IG looks inactive... You gotta take losses in business but 750k, ouch.",,,,,,
2,Classic solution to a nonexistent problem.,,,,,,
2,a handle for a handle,,,,,,
2,"Lori: ""Does it add weight?""
Of course not, Lori, they're made of helium!",,,,,,
2,How did that guy know Robert’s wife lmao,,,,,,
2,I thouht Robert just mouth kissed the presenters wife at  lmaooo,,,,,,
2,Seeing Robert so happy to see his wife and kids made my heart melt.,,,,,,
2,I can tell Robert really wasn’t comfortable with his family’s appearance,,,,,,
2,I made a remote control for my remote control,,,,,,
2,"Many babyseats now have S shaped handles to solve this exact problem. For that reason, I'm out.",,,,,,
2,Got to meet Roberts family!!,,,,,,
2,Rob wasn’t comfortable with his wife and kids being brought on the show. That energy was all a false facade. He took it all out on the owner if you listen closely.,,,,,,
2,The twist looks like it hurts with a 6 mo old,,,,,,
2,"Barbara: 

“Your name is Nathan and for that reason, I’m out”.",,,,,,
2,It seems like I have seen a baby carrier with the handle shaped like a Z so that the hand is in the right position when carrying.,,,,,,
2,That was cold.,,,,,,
2,The fact he didnt gift 2 for the twins is wild thats a missed mark right there,,,,,,
2,All car seat companies would have to do is switch how the handle is made. Done,,,,,,
2,Barbara’s reason was actually legitimate,,,,,,
2,This one feels weird lmaooo,,,,,,
2,It could be an accessory with the carrier on license. He could have kept his $750k and made more on interest!,,,,,,
2,"I wonder if that ""super got model"" was his wife lol",,,,,,
2,"I mean, 750.000 investment in a handle for a handle…",,,,,,
2,Who needs this handle to carry your child for a few min.,,,,,,
2,This guy curved around the whole issue to begin with and made a whole product for it. The issue was carrying the weight being awkward based off how far the handle was to the body. If he made some sort of handle/sleeve to hold the carrier closer then that's investable,,,,,,
2,How did we know barbera was out even before a single word was spoken,,,,,,
2,That arm twisted inside hurts that arm. Ive tried that way over and again. That's a bad way to carry. Besides there are already handles that angle ninety degrees and back to accommodate a parallel angle,,,,,,
2,Car seats are built universal now.,,,,,,
2,I knew it wasn’t in the bag when I saw how long the video was lol,,,,,,
2,Nathan was the Mark.,,,,,,
2,"I have 3 kids. Have never had an issue or worry about holding these things. Never thought ""Man, I need something to help me!""",,,,,,
2,I've been watching Fargo recently. Dude sounds like he's from Minnesota...,,,,,,
2,Most child seats have a twist in the handle now so your palm is turned in,,,,,,
2,Robert's wife gave him the $750k loool,,,,,,
2,"According to Barbara, you get your patents after you get all your sales ️",,,,,,
2,This is obsolete if they just redesign the handles on the car seats to not be symmetrical. To be designed to be carried at an angle in the hand with weight.,,,,,,
2,why do they think the technology is only for baby baskets? so many applications for this like plastic groceries - they hurt my fingers so much,,,,,,
2,She walks off stage not using them lol big hint,,,,,,
2,I am very sure there are more use cases for a product like this. I think this guy needs to work on that.,,,,,,
2,"This guy thought he could borrow Robert’s wife and kids. For that, he and his product had to be destroyed.",,,,,,
2,Any guy complaining about the weight of holding a baby is weak,,,,,,
2,Barbra said yes,,,,,,
2,"I’m surprised nobody pointed out or questioned what happens to the extra handle when the car seat is, I dunno…IN THE CAR?! Car seats go through A LOT of testing for safety, so I assume it needs to be removed each time. Where does it go? Not so convenient IMHO.",,,,,,
2,Robert married an aussie.. lets goooo,,,,,,
2,"Look guys, Barbara is out; That is INCREDIBLE!!",,,,,,
2,"In the end, it's an invention for people who dont have knowledge that makes it obsolete.",,,,,,
2,Car seats have had handles that go the other direction for many years so why spend money on a handle if you like your wrist that way just buy the car seat with that handle already on it,,,,,,
2,"it added the height when you carry, not good for shorter parents.",,,,,,
2,"It's a handle for a handle, next is a handle for the handle for the handle. And yes, u think this product can be designed for like $1000 max",,,,,,
2,I hate baby and food products too much at this point,,,,,,
2,I wish all men dressed like this guy,,,,,,
2,Its seem after this he shut down the website and took the loss.,,,,,,
2,"Barbara - I'm just sitting here, and I never invest, and for that reason, I'm out.",,,,,,
2,It is going to be a long road to get his patent money back.,,,,,,
2,just 3d print one out of abs or petg,,,,,,
2,"weird, I thought this was right in Lori's wheelhouse.",,,,,,
2,That's messed up lol they let him use Robert's kids then didn't give him a deal he probably thought it was a for sure deal when they said he would get to use them lol,,,,,,
2,That was weird,,,,,,
2,"Bringing out Robert's family seems a bit manipulative, Robert seemed annoyed throughout the pitch. I don't blame him.",,,,,,
2,They are only selling apparel now,,,,,,
2,Ashneer should see this,,,,,,
2,I would love to buy 1!,,,,,,
2,How did bro get Robert wife in on it ?,,,,,,
2,Who’s the women Robert keeps kissing on,,,,,,
2,did Sony pay her 50k to appear in the episode too?,,,,,,
2,MacGyver Ranch,,,,,,
2,Patent costs 4 x 10k = 40k. Tooling 60k. So max he spent was around 100k. Maybe 650k was his wages?,,,,,,
2,Anyone see the size of the rock on her finger damn,,,,,,
2,"good invention, easily replicated.",,,,,,
2,I thought it was a perfect product…,,,,,,
2,Which parent is carrying that for a long time. Its mostly in the car and to the house or clip onto the stroller.,,,,,,
2,$750 k is he crazy’s,,,,,,
2,"Brilliant idea, but just not practical. Nobody carries a baby carrier for more than a few minutes. You use a stroller. $750K is about $700K too much.",,,,,,
2,Wow! The criticism from the Sharks is that the creator doesn't have ENOUGH skin in the game!,,,,,,
2,It’s not a good product. If he was smart he would have designed it to distribute the weight evenly from the side. His handle still makes it awkward to carry those things.,,,,,,
2,"This is a baby shower gift at best. But in reality, I think it gets lost, or you figure you aren't going to carry long enough to justify getting it. And how many months is it actually useful for? I am intrigued by the claim of parents with back and arm problems, but I would want to see more on that.",,,,,,
2,If he had no patents with sales then it's nothing proprietary etc... Why didn't you patent it?,,,,,,
2,He shouldve given two to Kimmy. What a dunce lol,,,,,,
2,"Robert, you cheated on your wife and got divorced, come here, champ",,,,,,
2,I would’ve used it,,,,,,
2,"I don't think most people would trust this thing, besides your arm is still at angle away from the body, which is still cumbersome. I think Robert's way is better.",,,,,,
2,"A. Baby seats are a very temporary product. You only use them for a year or two.
B. You only carry the car seat for 2 minutes a day all together.",,,,,,
2,Her rings could buy the company 6 times over. BTW baby seat manufacturers already make a handle with a twist in the middle. This product is completely unnecessary.,,,,,,
2,I dont see the value either. Seems like a nice guy but you only carry a car seat for like a minute.,,,,,,
2,how’s it doing now?,,,,,,
2,"Whyd he go on the show lol, why doesnt Robert just invest",,,,,,
2,Big mistake to not give her 2 for free before she left with the kids holy smokes,,,,,,
2,"i would use it for grocery bags, i hate making trips back and fourth ...",,,,,,
2,They are eating this guy alive,,,,,,
2,What is the company name? I wanna invest,,,,,,
2,biggest hater moment ive seen on the tank from robert,,,,,,
2,yet another spoiled dude who wanted to be a CEO,,,,,,
2,"He's well-dressed and sharp, but may not be enough. (still watching.)

good idea bringing out the woman and baby, because this kind of product doesn't really fit with a single smooth-looking male.  Would expect him talking about car dealership routes to wealth.",,,,,,
2,How did the entrepreneur get in contact with robert's woman to get her to help him with the pitch O.o,,,,,,
2,Update - He sold the company for $1.7 Billion!,,,,,,
2,Stop the madness!,,,,,,
2,But that ring,,,,,,
2,Why do they always show the Sharks and their cheesy smiles when they walk in?,,,,,,
2,its ok but its not like we will carry it with us all day.. its not really quality of life thing to have.,,,,,,
2,kofa co tubsie opielolilo do uja,,,,,,
2,Majority of women are short imagine like taking 10cms from the ground... Any stair woudl make a hassle.,,,,,,
2,You can make 750k in the stock market like it's water lol whys 750k matter? Y'all lame lol,,,,,,
2,lol you haven’t done all the work yet so I’m out,,,,,,
2,He should have told her no it doesn’t add weight. Ridiculous question,,,,,,
2,"wow, bad bad bad all the way around!",,,,,,
2,car seat companies will just build it into the car seats,,,,,,
2,I don’t understand the point of this product. It doesn’t change the way a baby is carried in any real way.,,,,,,
2,"$750,000 for a handle?  Damn he could of invested in REAL ESTATE,GOLD,BIT COIN or ART",,,,,,
2,The product isn't convincing. He should've come up with a design that utilizes the body and shoulders not the arms and hands. What parents want is hands-free solutions and moms need something that utilizes less upper body muscles and more leg muscles and skeletal structure.,,,,,,
2,Waste product,,,,,,
2,I like you but am out,,,,,,
2,This is great for inner city families…. They’re missing it…. When you have to walk up six flights of stairs this is a need,,,,,,
2,i think it's out of business.,,,,,,
2,"$750 grand, Ouch-a-lompa.",,,,,,
2,I dont understand how he brought his wife out im confused,,,,,,
2,When did humans become so weak?,,,,,,
2,"Dumbest thing I've seen lately. Worst of all, it doesn't solve the problem of carrying the car seat!",,,,,,
2,making crap in china for 5 bucks and sell to dumb consumers 7 times the price. Great business.,,,,,,
2,Shark tank time is lunch time!,,,,,,
2,What a stupid product....just a waste of money,,,,,,
2,"This is another product that solves a problem that really isn't a problem. I carried those baby carriers for years, and there was really no problem (other than the weight).",,,,,,
2,Sheesh here early this is getting sad lol,,,,,,
2,Did the entreupenur really bring out Robert's wife and kids?! Baller move.,,,,,,
2,He talks waaayyyy tooooo ffffasasssst,,,,,,
2,Btw Robert cheated on his wife,,,,,,
2,Another editing job that ruins the show. Too short.,,,,,,
2,This might be the dullest entrepreneur to ever come in the tank,,,,,,
2,when you see a money hungry shark preparing a ridiculous and disgustingly greedy offer for your company,,,,,,
2,The fact that the  man used Roberts wife and children to demonstrate the product indicating that he must know Robert and then Robert turns around and trashes the product shows that this man is horrible at business and designing products.,,,,,,
2,Robert is really a family man,,,,,,
2,I hate that Robert cheated on his wife. I don’t care how much money people have. Loyalty can’t be bought.,,,,,,
2,Robert did seem angry that the entrepreneur brought his wife and kids.,,,,,,
2,Barbara: BBC Already uploaded this & for that reason I am out.,,,,,,
2,"his product packaging is bad, they need to be redesigned",,,,,,
2,750 k for that.. I think this guy is nuts,,,,,,
2,ROBERT ADOPTED KIDS LMAOOOOO,,,,,,
2,"He named his kids Hudson and Haithen???? And his wife is Kimmie???? 
Oh for christs sake, what is in the california water???",,,,,,
2,Plot twist: bro is the real father of those twins,,,,,,
2,Eating a turkey sandwich with a bag of chips,,,,,,
2,Trump 2024,,,,,,
2,What a genius product honestly.,,,,,,
2,UPDATE: The company blew up since airing and just did over 50 million a year in revenue,,,,,,
2,Is Robert always so fake?,,,,,,
2,The sharks fell off,,,,,,
2,"Mark- you don’t have all the answers, so I’m out",,,,,,
2,Company is world wide now. 3.4 billion in sales,,,,,,
2,Taco Bell for lunch today,,,,,,
2,Barbra wants him to sell the cure to cancer before pattening it. Genius,,,,,,
2,Damn Robert could’ve at least supported the baby’s head when snatching him up like that.,,,,,,
2,Mark Cuban advising Kamala Harris is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard. Specially after know what her policies are,,,,,,
2,55 sec to 0 views the sharks fell of,,,,,,
2,"So much was staged on this one, I can't trust it. And the editing vibe.... sigh... I just wanted to watch a real show, not the most hyper-edited faked episode ever. BOO!",,,,,,
2,Why is Robert 55 just having kids now,,,,,,
2,"I know it doesn't have anything to do with the video, but did you know that every planet in the solar system could fit in the distance that separates Earth from the Moon?",,,,,,
2,Status on Amazon: Defunct.,,,,,,
2,"He’s rich, she is beautiful with an accent.  Aka she’s a golddigger.",,,,,,
2,one drop and done.  baby gets injured or worse.  Bought at Walmart - KA CHING !!,,,,,,
2,Would never buy or use this.,,,,,,
2,Lol a product for lazy people,,,,,,
2,So stupid,,,,,,
2,Robert: “You’re here!!” 🥹🥹️,,,,,,
3,"who ever is running this channel , congrats i cant eat my food without sharktank",,,,,,
3,I love how Barbara interrupted those burger guys with “I’m speaking now” just to tell them she’s out.,,,,,,
3,"Barbara: I’M SPEAKING NOW
Robo dude: i’m sorry",,,,,,
3,When I first started watching this show I didn’t like Kevin but the more episodes I watched the more I liked him he is actually a quiet good businessman,,,,,,
3,"the first guys were overdoing it, it was a no brainer.. absolutely diabolical that they took that long, to accept a offer like this! kept throwing random counter offers out.. i wish mark played the card like 'If the next word coming out of your mouth is not  you will lose the offer'",,,,,,
3,The British doesn’t get the cheese company but she continues to eat the cheese even after she’s out,,,,,,
3,"Making that hand for $1800 stelling ir for $15500 that's called business.

But it's also one of the reasons why Healthcare is so expensive.",,,,,,
3,"""Real cheese made from plants"" ...",,,,,,
3,Mark is delusional if he thinks people in healthcare in those high up positions care about changing peoples lives. They care about the money,,,,,,
3,"The more burgers you want, the longer you have to wait.",,,,,,
3,very rude for Barbra to interrupt like that,,,,,,

3,I can't believe this video only hay 14K views!,,,,,,
3,"Can someone make a channel about Shark Tank?

Where they review old videos like this or even recently aired videos

And comment on how these companies are doing today? 

I always find myself, about watching these videos 

Googling “what happened to (blank) company since their appearance on Shark Tank”

Or maybe I’ll have to make that channel myself?",,,,,,
3,Amazing.,,,,,,
3,More repeat episodes yay!,,,,,,
3,Go Rambler!,,,,,,

3,I can’t believe robo burger took that deal. They got screwed in a major way,,,,,,
3,1800 to charge 15k,,,,,,
3,lol vegan cheese,,,,,,
3,"If I lease the Robo Burger machine for $3,000 per month and earn $3 per burger, with an optimistic estimate of selling 30 burgers daily, that’s $2,700 in monthly revenue (30 burgers × $3 × 30 days). This leaves me with a $300 monthly loss in the best-case scenario. Am I missing something here?",,,,,,
3,Did Robo Burger really win?,,,,,,
3,"Good pitches, unbearable loud music",,,,,,
3,HART HOUSE will go bankrupt...just saying.,,,,,,
3,So basically he gave away an extra 2% in the six percent deal  when he was getting the same 1 million in 4%,,,,,,
3,"Speed and taste do not equal quality food.
I don't eat fast food, I'm out.",,,,,,
3,"lol, you cant make real cheese without milk. 
Not saying it cant be good, but its not real cheese",,,,,,
3,Roboburger is so evil,,,,,,
3,Burger guys were stupid. If u jus want a loan then go to a bank. U dont need to give up equity  for a loan .,,,,,,

3,I once tried to sell my idea on Shark Tank the producer said no,,,,,,
3,I'm always surprised how few people actually understand how Cuban made the majority of his money.  Not the guy you think he is.,,,,,,
3,That nasty witch had to get in her last punch at the cheese people even though she was out and even though she knew they were getting an offer. I can’t stand her,,,,,,
3,"Sorry but Indian guy who had so much money to get so many degrees, he doesn’t need a damn investment from any investor",,,,,,

4,"Rashaun is doing it actually very clever, mentioning all the companies he invested in and then dropping . Clever move!",,,,,,
4,he set it up like he was abt to make her a offer and j broke her heart,,,,,,
4,all that to go out,,,,,,
4,That’s like 7-8x more expensive than regular milk.  Gotta get the cost WAYYYYYY down.  And Marks right… The benefits to the soil is nearly impossible to educate the customers at retail.,,,,,,
4,"Just realized Kevin looks like the puppet ""Walter"" when he makes certain expressions lol",,,,,,
4,Totally with this girl. Soil is so underrated. Almost magical. From little pieces of earth you get nutrition and firm texture that gets sun through leafs!!!!,,,,,,
4,"Sorry.  She blew it not mentioning the big launch.  ""You only get 1 shot.""",,,,,,
4,"at least kevin really was honest, the rest fluffed her up then went out",,,,,,

4,Can we please get small start ups with a cool idea back on here again,,,,,,
4,"Fun fact, after the pitch was done and the entrepreneur was heading back to her home she was being tailgated and pulled over by a car and the driver of the car was none other than the infamous witch Barbara. She stepped out of the car to say that she was OUT of the deal and OUT of her mind",,,,,,
4,Her prices are insane.,,,,,,
4,"Buckwheat has a high Oxalic acid content, (containing about 269 mg per 100g) which will eviscerate your cells.",,,,,,

4,Buckwheat is stupid healthy and completely overlooked in most nutrition in the USA,,,,,,
4,I like this girl. I feel bad for her,,,,,,
4,She said the second ingredient in Almond Milk is oil?? I just looked at my Almond Milk and didn't see oil anywhere.,,,,,,

4,Kevin is the soul of the show,,,,,,
4,She was great!,,,,,,
4,"8.29-10.99??!! Gtfo. That expensive for a small bottle, I'm good. And who wants buckwheat milk? We already have almond and oat milk. We don't need more different milks. Especially if they all gonna cost 10+ dollars. Its like these entrepreneurs don't really think about the current market in terms of who can afford these ""healthy"" items",,,,,,
4,"I like to check the website of interesting brands. They don’t sell through their website, they don’t tell you where you can buy it on their website. I checked Whole Foods and it’s not available in my area. Okay yeah I get the hint, my cash will stay in my wallet",,,,,,
4,From which season is that pitch?,,,,,,
4,Is Daymond a delayed reactor or something,,,,,,
4,This girl makes a $11 bottle of milk. Sold $50k and then said this is worth 2.5 million dollars today. She’s delusional,,,,,,

4,"Have a great diner, fellow Europeans!",,,,,,
4,damn what a bunch of cheapos.  this is one entrepreneur they should throw their money behind.  try to sell it it also at Trader Joe's.  I'd buy it if I saw it,,,,,,
4,Prove them wrong Kate,,,,,,
4,I like the product concept. I would like to try it.,,,,,,
4,Wearing 2 watches does Not look good.  sorry,,,,,,
4,I respect Lori a lot but it seems like she just mirrors all of marks decisions each episode,,,,,,
4,she got sweat stains,,,,,,

4,Where is she 2025,,,,,,
4,"did she really had to pull out the discrimination card?! Investors really don't care about your gender or skin color, it all has to do with how profitable you are.",,,,,,
4,"I would question her 40% of households buy plant based, I don't think its that high.  Also her price was landed, where is it coming from?  if she wants to save the planet it has to come from major agricultural areas not the cheapest area to make it",,,,,,
4,Thought cuban was off the show,,,,,,
4,I love how Damon being a multi millionaire at the top 0.01 percent of the US population still trying to pretend he is somehow a victim.,,,,,,
