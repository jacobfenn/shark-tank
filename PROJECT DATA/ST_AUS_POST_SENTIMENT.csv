The problem is of course, when someone like them don't invest full time into their product, is that it's also a sign that they aren't really committed to the product.
The excuse is of course is that they're saving money for the business. However in this case, they are already up and running, yet they can't make the profit grow fast enough to replace their jobs.
At that point, that's the point of the business, when you like your actual job more... because it makes more money?
It's why Steve said it's an ""attitude"" thing, not a business thing per se.

Investors also played it safe because they kept their jobs. It's pretty obvious how niche the product is, and it feels more like a gimmick more than anything. Compared to other products which are REVOLUTIONARY, this one is just a meh product. It's good, but it's not something everyone will buy. With that, it's pretty hard to throw everything away for that product.

The problem is of course, when someone like them don't invest full time into their product, is that it's also a sign that they aren't really committed to the product.
The excuse is of course is that they're saving money for the business. However in this case, they are already up and running, yet they can't make the profit grow fast enough to replace their jobs.
At that point, that's the point of the business, when you like your actual job more... because it makes more money?
It's why Steve said it's an ""attitude"" thing, not a business thing per se.

Investors also played it safe because they kept their jobs. It's pretty obvious how niche the product is, and it feels more like a gimmick more than anything. Compared to other products which are REVOLUTIONARY, this one is just a meh product. It's good, but it's not something everyone will buy. With that, it's pretty hard to throw everything away for that product.

That would value in at every 5% for $40k. So since all 3 were interested he should of done it where all 3 go in for 120k for 5% each. That way he got 3 sharks that will help push this into the open market as well as extra capital so he could get more then 2 tools he orginally wanted. As well as with his own evaluation it wouldn't be devalued by any means for his product. Ontop of Andrew USA contacts would get it here in the states faster. Personally I think the product is amazing and has alot of application's it could be used for depending the area conditions. But here in the states if you think alot of people have that kind of money for accessories you would be wrong. Yes there are alot of rich people here lol but the average person that gets a new truck is on loan already for x amount of years plus interest. Its somewhere around high 80% that dont have the cash to straight buy a 40k plus vehicle. So 1400 for retail or 2 grand for customers purchase is alot for the average worker which makes up most those sales. I feel like if he can get the price dropped but also make it where it could also be used as a fashion upgrade to your car/truck he would make even more. Like have different colors an designs by artists and plain colors would be cheaper then say a 2 tone color change on ur car. So if he could also market it cheaper an as a alternative to getting ur car painted it would sell alot more. He would also have to make it slimmer for that model and full body but still the possibility would be endless as well as reach more people.

How long was the study they looked at.

Additionally they need to ensure none of their other additives disrupt this process adding together 3 good things that should do what you say does not mean it will. Its not researched or supported.
