Huw handled this perfectly.

Throughout his Den experience- he was e a gentleman-- never looked desperate, clueless, or knackered by the negative comments. his vision for the future is almost solid- you can see it in his eyes, how intensely passionate he is about it.

And this is Peter Jones in one of his best (if not THE best) form as an astute businessman. It's uncanny how he was the only was who was thoroughly paying attention to what Huw was saying... even without experience in publishing, his assessment of Huw and the potential of this endeavor was totally on point  already... def' my favorite dragon <3

On top that he's making about 15 pounds a day and he's asking for 150k for 30% valuing his business at half a million pounds!!! Amazing how someone who seems so level headed - can be so complete and utterly deluded!

Wouldn't any form of a door bolt only be accessed from one side? Steplock might be feasible for a modern electronic switch, so that might not be much of an issue with that anyways. But why would I need to keep a burglar  my house rather than keep them outside in the first place? If the dude's in, he's going to get out unless all my windows and doors have huge automatic metal shutters like in secret agent movies, which I doubt more than 200 buildings have in real life.

I do agree that a proper test should've been prepared to confirm Steplock is unbreakable, though. Or try to make the pitch different; maybe less of the ultimate product and more just a valid option.",,,

I’m still having a hard time understanding why these guys didn’t go for Deborah’s deal and went with another.  I’m guessing they figured they’d make more money doing a different deal and were afraid she wouldn’t go for it.  
They definitely should have just confronted her and been honest about their feelings.  Hopefully Deborah is looking out for them more than herself when it comes to money.  I realize she’s a dragon and has a reputation...  but she’s a mega multimillionaire already and these guys are not.  Yes it sucks she spent 5k on her deal that fell through but 5k to her and 5k to everyone else is very different.  Her complaining about losing 5k would be like me bitching my friend out because I spent $5 dollars in gas money driving to her house and her not being there.  It’s money but not enough to bring up as a major issue.  
I just hope these dragons and sharks from these shows keep that in mind.  I know they have reputations that they care about.  Every dragon and shark wants to be known as the “smartest” and most “successful” so I too would be worried a bit if I were those guys.  
Anyways I really like Deborah.   She’s super smart, very honest and business savvy.  I hope it all works out for all of them.",2,,

The fact he chooses to immediately express it is suggestive of a toddler's mind. This mixture of wordly arrogance and petulance is what you'd expect from a spoiled despot. He simply always seems too greedy for anyone else's own good. He's like a shark - you'll frequently see him humourlessly eying the pitcher with beady eyes before he does what he possibly thinks is a charming Cowell-like about-face by smiling. But the shark never shows you its gleaming grin until its jaws are eagerly waiting to devour you.,12,,

Lost My Name, the London-based startup that uses tech to create and publish personalised story books for children, has raised $8.5 million in Series B funding. It is also revealing an upcoming tie-in with the Roald Dahl Estate, owners of IP such as Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory.
The round was led by Ravensburger, a leading European publisher of games, puzzles, and children’s books, so it’s a strategic investment of sorts. Existing investors, Google Ventures, Project A Ventures, Greycroft, The Chernin Group, and Allen & Co, also participated. I understand part of the round is a venture debt facility from Silicon Valley Bank, too.
In related news, Lost My Name’s name is lost no more. The startup (not so) quietly re-branded last week as “Wonderbly,” a move that is likely part of a bid to move beyond the company’s original title and only ‘hit’ so far, the wonderful “The Little Boy/Girl Who Lost His/Her Name,” which has sold over 2.7 million copies and claims to be the leading picture book in the markets Wonderblyoperates.
Co-founder and CEO Asi Sharabi told me during a catch up call last week that the company has created six new products this year, with more to come. And most impressively, Wonderbly has signed a partnership with the Roald Dahl Estate.
The Joint-IP project will see the two organisations work together to “open the gates” of Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, presumably via some kind of book infused with clever use of data and personalisation. I, for one, can’t wait.
The project also ties into what Sharabi told me last year when he said the startup was actively seeking to partner with outside creatives and companies, as it opens up the platform. “Technology and business models scale but creativity doesn’t,” he said at the time.
IP as loved as Willy Wonka, on the other hand, is infinitely scalable, so this, along with today’s funding, is a nice win for Wonderbly, a company I’ve always thought needed patient capital rather than bucket loads of move fast, break things-styled VC.
That’s something Sharabi doesn’t dispute either, citing the startup’s investment mantra as “added value over capital,” and pressing home that Ravensburger brings over 100 years of operational experience in the children’s entertainment space.
As we wrapped up our call, I asked him how he managed to successfully pitch the Roald Dahl Estate, and he revealed that they actually reached out to him. The organisation was on the look out for new creative opportunities beyond its recent ventures into Hollywood and the newly-named Wonderbly seemed just the golden ticket.",18,1 reply,

Most people on this show want their brand to be targeted towards luxury consumers, for eg. Food items, Waitrose.. I know it's good to be associated with these successful brands who target middle class and the well-off, but it just gives the individuals who are trying to sell their products a reputation that they think their product should start off at the very top. This product could have a much wider audience, and by jumping into luxury shopping brands and department stores, where the majority of the population can't afford it, it excludes a large chunk of people, before they even enter the market.",4,3 replies,

The core concept - a compass-arrow - isn't fundamentally a bad idea. It could be changed with software modifications to account for cul-de-sacs and traffic issues. I could see this adding value to people who just don't want to have their £50-70/month contract phone on their bike.

But not at £100.00. This would easily retail from £30.00 to £55.00. It'd be a strong seller on e-Commerce platforms like Amazon, and it'd sell reasonably well in Argos/John Lewis/Tesco/Halfords.

And the reasons why is You can download offline maps for phones for 20 quid or use Google maps.  You can have the phone actually tell you where to go with the screen off using the speaker  and use a voice command to turn on the screen if you like to see exactly where you are. A lot off apps let you pick what screen you want to use. Better off with a 50 euro phone. Any decent cyclist will have a portable power bank with their phone,,,

I think it's highly likely that is the way its going because 1. People do not want to work in care and it is very difficult to find high quality care staff when the wages are so low. 2. The younger generations are not having kids so this will compound the issue when they get older.

The working class no longer want to take the 'unskilled' jobs so we are going to have to find solutions, we can't just rely on open border immigration to plug the gap like we have been doing. Robotic care in the future is highly likely based on these trends.",2,,

If a human still has to sit there and control it, whats the point of having the robot? Why doesnt the human controller just do the job? Especially jobs where human connection is important, or at least preferred, like care homes. I imagine some guy sat in his bedroom while the robot in the bar pours a customer a drink. This is moving towards a lazier and isolated society, where people dont need to leave the house cause they can do everything from home. Going to be like wall-e in no time.

While i can see the advantage to something like a difficult surgery that requires an expert from a different country, i cannot understand the need to replace things like bartenders and care home workers. These jobs do not need specialists, so why do they need remote-controlled robots? Surely there are enough humans locally to fill these kind of jobs?",1,3 replies,
