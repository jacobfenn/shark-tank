This is a scary time for new investors but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions.

Buy and just trade long term more than ever, I was able to flip my 0.7 BTC to 5.2 btc by implementing Wyckoff Associates daily trading signals despite the state of the market","","7 replies"
