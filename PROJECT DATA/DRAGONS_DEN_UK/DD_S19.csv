If a human still has to sit there and control it, whats the point of having the robot? Why doesnt the human controller just do the job? Especially jobs where human connection is important, or at least preferred, like care homes. I imagine some guy sat in his bedroom while the robot in the bar pours a customer a drink. This is moving towards a lazier and isolated society, where people dont need to leave the house cause they can do everything from home. Going to be like wall-e in no time.

While i can see the advantage to something like a difficult surgery that requires an expert from a different country, i cannot understand the need to replace things like bartenders and care home workers. These jobs do not need specialists, so why do they need remote-controlled robots? Surely there are enough humans locally to fill these kind of jobs?","1","3 replies"
