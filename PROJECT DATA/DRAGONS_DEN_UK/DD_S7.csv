I’m still having a hard time understanding why these guys didn’t go for Deborah’s deal and went with another.  I’m guessing they figured they’d make more money doing a different deal and were afraid she wouldn’t go for it.  
They definitely should have just confronted her and been honest about their feelings.  Hopefully Deborah is looking out for them more than herself when it comes to money.  I realize she’s a dragon and has a reputation...  but she’s a mega multimillionaire already and these guys are not.  Yes it sucks she spent 5k on her deal that fell through but 5k to her and 5k to everyone else is very different.  Her complaining about losing 5k would be like me bitching my friend out because I spent $5 dollars in gas money driving to her house and her not being there.  It’s money but not enough to bring up as a major issue.  
I just hope these dragons and sharks from these shows keep that in mind.  I know they have reputations that they care about.  Every dragon and shark wants to be known as the “smartest” and most “successful” so I too would be worried a bit if I were those guys.  
Anyways I really like Deborah.   She’s super smart, very honest and business savvy.  I hope it all works out for all of them.","2"
