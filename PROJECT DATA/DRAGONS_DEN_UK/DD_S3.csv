This would’ve been a useful thing four decades ago, but his idea didn’t account for how rapidly tech would develop. I feel bad for this guy, but he was 20 years too late. In case anyone is wondering, it’s a well-known London fact that black cab drivers have to pass a test about where every street in the city is. They had GPS (metaphorically) before GPS was widely available, so they knew best back then. Either way you cut it though, the sharks (or dragons?) knew better.","4"
