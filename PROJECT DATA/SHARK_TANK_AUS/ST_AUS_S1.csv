I think these guys are being very responsible entrepreneurs by putting their established situations first and not diving into the unknown risking everything and potentially losing all they have over an idea. It's clear to me that these two are responsible and still passionate about their product, it's a damn good one! Shame on the sharks for cutting into them for having a safety net. I know somebody who put everything he had on the line trying to get a business going and he just lost his house and put his family life into complete termoil because of his irresponsible behaviour. Not a very smart thing to do and might I say a pretty selfish thing to do when you have a family. I can't stand behind their logic. It's easy for them to sit back now in their ivory towers with their comfort and millions while they point the finger and criticize these two for having a safety net, makes me sick. Just because it worked out for them doesn't mean it always will for everyone. A person has to eat and feed their family in the meantime, that's what matters. This is yet another classic tale of the rich being completely removed from common sense and reality. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that it worked out for them but their projects could have just as easily blown up in their faces while their families would have taken the brunt. Terrible advice on their part. I'm out.","9"
