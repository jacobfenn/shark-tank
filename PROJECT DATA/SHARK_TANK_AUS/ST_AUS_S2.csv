This idea is amazing. The only downside being the magnets. Also, Steve seems to be a mixed bag. On one hand, he is willing to screw over his partner... on the other hand he can definitely get some money going because of that

Andrew could definitely be a huge benefit because of his eyes on expansion and for the ability to cut deals on the fly with clauses that benefit the company.

Glenn seems straight up easy to work with and seems to be more sales oriented.
