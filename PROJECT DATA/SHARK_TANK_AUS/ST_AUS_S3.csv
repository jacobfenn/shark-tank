The bar's FORMULA has  been tested for the specific properties claimed. The syntax of the packaging text implied the formula/_whole bar_ had data behind it, which it didn't. A simple wording tweak is all it really takes to resolve that, though, for sure. Idk about laws in Australia specifically, but going off my US-based understanding of enforcement norms and some language-geekness, that's what I've got.

For an example of why this matters, consider that, like ... hmm ... Iodine (if I recall right) binds to lots of metals, so one shouldn't use a metal spoon to stir a smoothie if taking a liquid iodine supplement for instance, so someone could make a formula for a supplement that contains iodine but also unthinkingly put a bunch of iron in it too, and then they could accurately label it as having an  that yields the benefits of iodine or whatever (this is a really crappy example because iodine is more of a lacking-it-messes-you-up thing than a taking-extra-helps-with-something thing, just work with me here), but wouldn't be able to reasonably claim the whole  yields those benefits, because if tested, it wouldn't, because the iodine would be all bound up or something. Grain of salt this whole example. Pretend the elements are made up. Point is, stuff can cancel other stuff out or synergize badly or do other weird stuff, and clear specific syntax matters a lot in general and especially when it comes to health facts","2"

The bar's FORMULA has  been tested for the specific properties claimed. The syntax of the packaging text implied the formula/_whole bar_ had data behind it, which it didn't. A simple wording tweak is all it really takes to resolve that, though, for sure. Idk about laws in Australia specifically, but going off my US-based understanding of enforcement norms and some language-geekness, that's what I've got.

For an example of why this matters, consider that, like ... hmm ... Iodine (if I recall right) binds to lots of metals, so one shouldn't use a metal spoon to stir a smoothie if taking a liquid iodine supplement for instance, so someone could make a formula for a supplement that contains iodine but also unthinkingly put a bunch of iron in it too, and then they could accurately label it as having an  that yields the benefits of iodine or whatever (this is a really crappy example because iodine is more of a lacking-it-messes-you-up thing than a taking-extra-helps-with-something thing, just work with me here), but wouldn't be able to reasonably claim the whole  yields those benefits, because if tested, it wouldn't, because the iodine would be all bound up or something. Grain of salt this whole example. Pretend the elements are made up. Point is, stuff can cancel other stuff out or synergize badly or do other weird stuff, and clear specific syntax matters a lot in general and especially when it comes to health facts","2"

1) supplement companies fall under legal scrutiny regularly. The often operate as llcs and so when thecompany gets sued into oblivion they file bankruptcy, and then the owners create a new llc, slightly tweak the products and come back branded differently
2) health trends change rapidly, and people follow the trends more than the science. The trouble with that is it leads to the the aforementioned legal scrutiny. For example, lots of products right now have heavy ‘keto’ branding, but if you look at the nutritional info, a lot of these products contain enough carbs in a single serving to kick you out of ketosis. The industry is rapidly moving from trend to trend, so false advertisement is a consistent problem.

Hope this works out for these guys, they seem really passionate about it,",""

The chocolate does still exist and sells well however sans the claim. The issue is this science supports that those ingredients are associated with improvements but there are a lot of questions that must be answered starting with the study the claim was pulled from. How long was the study they looked at. A longitudinal study (over the course of many many years often decades) does very little to support the claim on the back as their claim would be seen as a happening over a short period of time. Additionally they need to ensure none of their other additives disrupt this process adding together 3 good things that should do what you say does not mean it will. Its not researched or supported. Yet another issue that comes into play is dose is there a certain amount needed to be taken get this effect? Its a serious and important question. The fact that they dropped it from their marketing says that it was either too much to do the research so they didn't bother or they did it and it came up negative.",""
