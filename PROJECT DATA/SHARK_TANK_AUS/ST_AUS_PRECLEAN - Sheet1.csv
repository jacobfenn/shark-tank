I think these guys are being very responsible entrepreneurs by putting their established situations first and not diving into the unknown risking everything and potentially losing all they have over an idea. It's clear to me that these two are responsible and still passionate about their product, it's a damn good one! Shame on the sharks for cutting into them for having a safety net. I know somebody who put everything he had on the line trying to get a business going and he just lost his house and put his family life into complete termoil because of his irresponsible behaviour. Not a very smart thing to do and might I say a pretty selfish thing to do when you have a family. I can't stand behind their logic. It's easy for them to sit back now in their ivory towers with their comfort and millions while they point the finger and criticize these two for having a safety net, makes me sick. Just because it worked out for them doesn't mean it always will for everyone. A person has to eat and feed their family in the meantime, that's what matters. This is yet another classic tale of the rich being completely removed from common sense and reality. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that it worked out for them but their projects could have just as easily blown up in their faces while their families would have taken the brunt. Terrible advice on their part. I'm out.",9

May be India is the biggest cricket market but it will be a risky market for this product. India's beach culture is not like the other countries he mentioned. Indians play cricket everywhere but beach cricket is not that big a thing in India unlike Australia and New Zealand.

Indeed, keeping their existing jobs shows prudence and is a financial back-up to keep the product selling if things don't go according to plan.  I wish them well.",
1,@nimagameroil1099,4 years ago,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVik4I48Ee0&lc=UgzeVvNILNs85mcl4Sp4AaABAg,The investors are right and also having another job is not bad for your business. The problem is Looking for investors is only really for people that are at the end of the line that need the money right now. These guys can always rely on their jobs so they don't need investors.and the sharks know that so that's why they are not happy giving money to someone that doesn't need it. Someone that doesn't need it doesn't value a shark as much as others and sharks dont want that... Hope that made sense,2

Or they'll complain that the individual isn't devoting enough hours as if they themselves devote any significant amount of time into the vast majority of their businesses.

I remember they complained about an actress only putting 30 hours or so a week into her business but the business was making a good amount of money regardless. The sharks were upset that she weren't working 80 hours a week. But she didn't need to work that many hours.... Why? She has other passions and this was just a way to allow her to pursue that passion. Her and her mother were making a significant amount of money working for themselves 30 hours a week.",

1,@TheFrogInYourClosetWatchingYou,4 years ago (edited),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVik4I48Ee0&lc=Ugzi_t0rZdRd3mEFJDp4AaABAg,"These sharks are delusional half the episodes they berate people for putting too much money into their company then the other half they complain because not enough money has been put into it.

Or they'll complain that the individual isn't devoting enough hours as if they themselves devote any significant amount of time into the vast majority of their businesses.

I remember they complained about an actress only putting 30 hours or so a week into her business but the business was making a good amount of money regardless. The sharks were upset that she weren't working 80 hours a week. But she didn't need to work that many hours.... Why? She has other passions and this was just a way to allow her to pursue that passion. Her and her mother were making a significant amount of money working for themselves 30 hours a week.",

That would value in at every 5% for $40k. So since all 3 were interested he should of done it where all 3 go in for 120k for 5% each. That way he got 3 sharks that will help push this into the open market as well as extra capital so he could get more then 2 tools he orginally wanted. As well as with his own evaluation it wouldn't be devalued by any means for his product. Ontop of Andrew USA contacts would get it here in the states faster. Personally I think the product is amazing and has alot of application's it could be used for depending the area conditions. But here in the states if you think alot of people have that kind of money for accessories you would be wrong. Yes there are alot of rich people here lol but the average person that gets a new truck is on loan already for x amount of years plus interest. Its somewhere around high 80% that dont have the cash to straight buy a 40k plus vehicle. So 1400 for retail or 2 grand for customers purchase is alot for the average worker which makes up most those sales. I feel like if he can get the price dropped but also make it where it could also be used as a fashion upgrade to your car/truck he would make even more. Like have different colors an designs by artists and plain colors would be cheaper then say a 2 tone color change on ur car. So if he could also market it cheaper an as a alternative to getting ur car painted it would sell alot more. He would also have to make it slimmer for that model and full body but still the possibility would be endless as well as reach more people.

This idea is amazing. The only downside being the magnets. Also, Steve seems to be a mixed bag. On one hand, he is willing to screw over his partner... on the other hand he can definitely get some money going because of that

Andrew could definitely be a huge benefit because of his eyes on expansion and for the ability to cut deals on the fly with clauses that benefit the company.

Glenn seems straight up easy to work with and seems to be more sales oriented.

That would be the tough call in my opinion, but since he convinced them to both take part... I think this guy chose perfectly",

And their 'pissed off' facial expressions and body language, always on cue for camera, is pathetic. These guys here genuinely show interest in the entrepreneur. They ask questions. They don't get nasty when they don't hear what they wanna hear. 
I love this show",

US sharks never offer exactly what they want or like .000000000001% of the time maybe close to the offer. Or lori’s stupid golden ticket offer. The two shows definitely have different personalities with the investors. Especially when it’s a start up. The US investors would make a lot more brutal offers if it’s just a start up. They also let him take forever to make a decision. These investors aren’t sharks there more like dolphins.,

The bar's FORMULA has  been tested for the specific properties claimed. The syntax of the packaging text implied the formula/_whole bar_ had data behind it, which it didn't. A simple wording tweak is all it really takes to resolve that, though, for sure. Idk about laws in Australia specifically, but going off my US-based understanding of enforcement norms and some language-geekness, that's what I've got.

For an example of why this matters, consider that, like ... hmm ... Iodine (if I recall right) binds to lots of metals, so one shouldn't use a metal spoon to stir a smoothie if taking a liquid iodine supplement for instance, so someone could make a formula for a supplement that contains iodine but also unthinkingly put a bunch of iron in it too, and then they could accurately label it as having an  that yields the benefits of iodine or whatever (this is a really crappy example because iodine is more of a lacking-it-messes-you-up thing than a taking-extra-helps-with-something thing, just work with me here), but wouldn't be able to reasonably claim the whole  yields those benefits, because if tested, it wouldn't, because the iodine would be all bound up or something. Grain of salt this whole example. Pretend the elements are made up. Point is, stuff can cancel other stuff out or synergize badly or do other weird stuff, and clear specific syntax matters a lot in general and especially when it comes to health facts",2

The bar's FORMULA has  been tested for the specific properties claimed. The syntax of the packaging text implied the formula/_whole bar_ had data behind it, which it didn't. A simple wording tweak is all it really takes to resolve that, though, for sure. Idk about laws in Australia specifically, but going off my US-based understanding of enforcement norms and some language-geekness, that's what I've got.

For an example of why this matters, consider that, like ... hmm ... Iodine (if I recall right) binds to lots of metals, so one shouldn't use a metal spoon to stir a smoothie if taking a liquid iodine supplement for instance, so someone could make a formula for a supplement that contains iodine but also unthinkingly put a bunch of iron in it too, and then they could accurately label it as having an  that yields the benefits of iodine or whatever (this is a really crappy example because iodine is more of a lacking-it-messes-you-up thing than a taking-extra-helps-with-something thing, just work with me here), but wouldn't be able to reasonably claim the whole  yields those benefits, because if tested, it wouldn't, because the iodine would be all bound up or something. Grain of salt this whole example. Pretend the elements are made up. Point is, stuff can cancel other stuff out or synergize badly or do other weird stuff, and clear specific syntax matters a lot in general and especially when it comes to health facts",2

1) supplement companies fall under legal scrutiny regularly. The often operate as llcs and so when thecompany gets sued into oblivion they file bankruptcy, and then the owners create a new llc, slightly tweak the products and come back branded differently
2) health trends change rapidly, and people follow the trends more than the science. The trouble with that is it leads to the the aforementioned legal scrutiny. For example, lots of products right now have heavy ‘keto’ branding, but if you look at the nutritional info, a lot of these products contain enough carbs in a single serving to kick you out of ketosis. The industry is rapidly moving from trend to trend, so false advertisement is a consistent problem.

Hope this works out for these guys, they seem really passionate about it,",

She's basically implying every company with any claim about their supplement will have to go to clinical trials, which I'm 99% sure most companies don't, they just go based off preexisting studies. Also, im not sure how Australia does it, but in a lot of places regulation for supplements is really lax. It's not the same as food or medicine. Its probably a good idea to eventually get a clinical trial because then you'd get more precise data, but I don't think it's illegal?",

She's basically implying every company with any claim about their supplement will have to go to clinical trials, which I'm 99% sure most companies don't, they just go based off preexisting studies. Also, im not sure how Australia does it, but in a lot of places regulation for supplements is really lax. It's not the same as food or medicine. Its probably a good idea to eventually get a clinical trial because then you'd get more precise data, but I don't think it's illegal?",

The chocolate does still exist and sells well however sans the claim. The issue is this science supports that those ingredients are associated with improvements but there are a lot of questions that must be answered starting with the study the claim was pulled from. How long was the study they looked at. A longitudinal study (over the course of many many years often decades) does very little to support the claim on the back as their claim would be seen as a happening over a short period of time. Additionally they need to ensure none of their other additives disrupt this process adding together 3 good things that should do what you say does not mean it will. Its not researched or supported. Yet another issue that comes into play is dose is there a certain amount needed to be taken get this effect? Its a serious and important question. The fact that they dropped it from their marketing says that it was either too much to do the research so they didn't bother or they did it and it came up negative.,
